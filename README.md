PsiCLASS
=======

Described in: 

xxxx

PsiCLASS includes source code from the [`samtools`](https://github.com/samtools/samtools). 

### What is PsiCLASS?

PsiCLASS is a reference-based transcriptome assembler for single or multiple RNA-seq samples. 

### Install

1. Clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mourisl/class3), e.g. with `git clone https://github.com/mourisl/class3.git`
2. Run `make` in the repo directory

CLASS3 depends on [pthreads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads) and samtools dependends on [zlib](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib).


### Usage

	Usage: ./psiclass [OPTIONS]
		Required:
			-b STRING: the path to the BAM files. Use comma to separate ultiple bam files
				or
			--lb STRING: the path to the file listing the alignments bam files
		Optional:
			-s STRING: the path to the trusted splice sites file (default: not used)
			-o STRING: the prefix of output files (default: ./psiclass)
			-t INT: number of threads (default: 1)
			--hasMateIdSuffix: the read id has suffix such as .1, .2 for a mate pair. (default: false)
			--stage INT:  (default: 0)
				0-start from beginning (building splice sites for each sample)
				1-start from building subexon files for each sample
				2-start from combining subexon files
				3-start from assembly the transcripts
				4-start from voting the consensus transcripts

### Output

In your current directory or the directory specified by -o, you will find the output files of PsiCLASS:

	Sample-wise GTF files: (psiclass)_sample_{0,1,...,n-1}.gtf
	Meta-assembly GTF file: (psiclass)_vote.gtf

You will also find other files generated by PsiCLASS in several subdirectories:

	Intron files: splice/*
	Subexon graph files: subexon/*
